# The Project Outline (Part I)

## Project Summary
This project was focused on providing current data on the status of international education to the Board of Directors for Teach for All. The intent was to practice mocking up and researchin data that the Board might see at a board meeting to decide a strategic plan for the next ten years. I focused my data presentation on the urgency and importance of their work and the exploration of what educational data might matter when making the decision about which countries would rise to the attention of having the most need for a partnership with Teach for All. 

**High level summary???**
This project is meant to be apart of the Board's full scope of work and necessary data for the decision making process. This was a much larger focus than I realized at the beginning of the assignment weeks ago. 

## Project Structure: 

**_1. Teach for All's Partner Network:_** Presenting a general overview of the Partner Network allows me to showcase some of complexity of the work being done by this nonprofit and also visualize the impact it's making. It's a multidimensional organism with each partner in the network following a generally similar phasing of growth and an ongoing self-awareness of the individual needs of each country. While I don't dive into this necessarily, it's important that visualizing the structure of this particular component convey complexity and deep, intertwining connections to being involved in an issue as huge as international education issues.

**_2. Teach for Portugal:_** Presenting a dashboard appearance that provides a nutshell of possible data points to consider about one of the current partners was important to me. It sets up the model of what can be assumed available for each country equally. Teach for Portugal became an official and publicized part of the TFA Partner Network within the past few weeks (February 2019). That makes it exciting to present because it is a fresh pivot point both for the country and for the TFA organization.

**_3. International Education Disparities_** This was the meat of my focus for most of this project. I held on to this as a means of pivoting from the excitement and powerful mission of TFA to the disparate truth behind the status of educational landscapes across the world. The disparities are so intertwined and destructive. I don't believe the Teach for All is the single answer to solving them by any means, but the work being done by Teach for All is an example of a stakeholder willing to also be a part of the solution. Teach for All's focus is making a difference by starting within the classroom through the relationship and leadership role of the teacher with the student, the school, the community, and beyond. These disparities cannot be solved by a teacher alone, but the quality of the education no matter what surrounds a child does depend on the educational environment and support created by the teachers that lead the way.

**_4. A Variety of Educational Statistics_** This is where I wanted to bring logic in and the decision making process to take over. The story so far has been
