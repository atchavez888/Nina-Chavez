# The Project Outline

## Project Summary
This project was focused on providing current data on the status of international education to the Board of Directors for Teach for All. The intent was to practice mocking up and researching data that the Board might see at a board meeting to decide a strategic plan for the next ten years. I focused my data presentation on the urgency and importance of their work and the exploration of what educational data might matter when making the decision about which countries would rise to the attention of having the most need for a partnership with Teach for All. This project is meant to be apart of the Board's full scope of work and necessary data for the decision making process. This was a much larger focus than I realized at the beginning of the assignment weeks ago. 

## Project Structure

**_1. Teach for All's Partner Network:_** Presenting a general overview of the Partner Network allows me to showcase some of complexity of the work being done by this nonprofit and also visualize the impact it's making. It's a multidimensional organism with each partner in the network following a generally similar phasing of growth and an ongoing self-awareness of the individual needs of each country. While I don't dive into this necessarily, it's important that visualizing the structure of this particular component convey complexity and deep, intertwining connections to being involved in an issue as huge as international education issues.

**_2. Teach for Portugal:_** Presenting a dashboard appearance that provides a nutshell of possible data points to consider about one of the current partners was important to me. It sets up the model of what can be assumed available for each country equally. Teach for Portugal became an official and publicized part of the TFA Partner Network within the past few weeks (February 2019). That makes it exciting to present because it is a fresh pivot point both for the country and for the TFA organization.

**_3. International Education Disparities_** This was the meat of my focus for most of this project. I held on to this as a means of pivoting from the excitement and powerful mission of TFA to the disparate truth behind the status of educational landscapes across the world. The disparities are so intertwined and destructive. I don't believe the Teach for All is the single answer to solving them by any means, but the work being done by Teach for All is an example of a stakeholder willing to also be a part of the solution. Teach for All's focus is making a difference by starting within the classroom through the relationship and leadership role of the teacher with the student, the school, the community, and beyond. These disparities cannot be solved by a teacher alone, but the quality of the education no matter what surrounds a child does depend on the educational environment and support created by the teachers that lead the way.

**_4. A Variety of Educational Statistics_** This is where I wanted the decision-making process to take over. The story now takes us to the action which is to get a taste of what is taken into consideration by the Board as they begin to explore and pursue strategic planning in the expansion of the Partner Netowrk. My statistics focus on a variety of educational touch points to consider but a deeper, multi-dimensional dive than that is required such as the consideration of political climates and willingness of countries to partner and invest in what it will take. Here, I wanted to atleast explore what resources are publicly available on the topic of exploring and possibly ranking the needs of what Teach for All can offer in the work to tackle international education inequity.

## Data Sources 

  * [UNESCO Institute of Statistics](): This has been the most thorough source of information on the subject of individual country's educational data available to me.
  
  * [UN Development Programme](): This is where I collected open-source data related to standardized international education exams. 
  
  * [UNICEF Organization Education](): 
  
  * [UNESCO World Inequity Database of Education](https://www.education-inequalities.org/indicators/edu4#?sort=mean&dimension=sex&group=all&age_group=edu4_2024&countries=all): The data is accessible at the top near the main headline titled "export." This data was the basis of selecting this topic. The disparities here drive my exploration of what is holding children back from getting an equal education. I originally planned on only needing this data, but soon realized it was very difficult for me to manipulate considering its structure. I extrapolated various key points and sought direction from this full encompassing data for each individual country.

## Final Data Story

**Intendended Audience**

The Teach for All Board of Directors and the two Global Ambassadors are meant to be the audience for this presentation and data. The Board is composed of CEOS, Global Affairs leaders at major universities, international government representatives, and directors of intergovernmental economics organizations such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development who are all immersed in international education issues, initiatives, and cutting edge advancements. While the Global Ambassadors are on the younger side of the spectrum, the Board itself is composed of middle-aged and older/wiser leaders who have been involved in education and the international stage for decades. This group doesn't need a long introduction into the disparities of education inequity, so diving deep into the current state of the matters are key to moving the conversation along to the meat of the decision-making. They are familiar with almost all terminology and leaders in the data sources.

To make this project work for for the audience, I made sure to present highly professional visuals with a lot of information in digestible designs. Also, because of the knowledge "in the room," it was important to search on all platforms to show a breadth and depth of access to information. 

**Process and Design Decisions**
The work accomplished over the last three weeks have been engrossed in **research** and atleast three redesigns in the progression of the story. I began with a general idea that I could calculate financial drive to the conversation and sculpt it be a "further along" part of the discussion that actually preps the Board for meetings or presentations with funders and potential funders. That quickly changed to focus more on the educational data aspect of the conversation which had much more data accessible. It was also in my scope of comfort and ability to speak thoroughly on a dimension of the strategic planning process. 

After going to the GCC at Hunt Library, the storyline changed to focus on a particular region of the world to help me reign in the story. We selected Sub-Saharan Africa. I worked on that angle for a week before accepting that I was still choosing a large topic that wasn't actually helping the story. If I stayed with Sub-Saharan Africa, I would have to pull out and remind everyone of the global mission rather than a region BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY Sub-Saharan Africa may have so many political and other variables involved in the relationships building to build a bridge to building a relationship. 

Instead, I decided to latch onto the idea of Teach for Portugal and explore the mission and work of Teach for All through the new partner since new partners are the topic of the whole 60-seconds and research. 

As for the **design**, it developed from the simple three pieces as discussed in class to four because of discussions at GCC and then further reflection on data available within the timeframe. The design was still relatively easily designed because of the logical progression of storytelling. I simply changed the regional/national example.

Shorthand is tough, and I got too comfortable working within Infogram and Github! I learned that Infogram is a stronger platform that Datawrapper for someone unfamiliar with coding. It allowed me to get farther with interactive components I wanted.
