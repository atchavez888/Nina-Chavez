# Telling Stories with Data

This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me

I am a second year Arts Management student. I particularly enjoy bringing a community together through the performing arts. Before coming to graduate school, though, I was an elementary music teacher in South Texas which is actually where I grew up. I spent four years as a teacher learning about the relationship between data and the public education system while actually having fun reaffirming how amazingly powerful the arts and culture are in a child's life and their community. The combination helped me realize that furthering my education in arts management would further my passion for serving and building communities.

My current internship is with the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council reviewing survey data and building presentations and reports for internal and external use. 

# What I Hope to Learn

I love how data enhances communication. It can further clarify, reveal outliers or unexpected results, and bring patterns to the surface. Data also can be confusing, overwhelming, and a bit hard to filter through whether working with it or being presented with overly manipulated conclusions. When data and the arts intersect they can enhance experiences and the design and creation of further experiences. Through this class, I hope to become better at visualizing data to communicate with all stakeholders. I want to be able to create high quality data visuals to support my work. Also, I want to be able to more efficiently challenge data presented to me.
