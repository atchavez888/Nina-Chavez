This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

**About Me**

I am a second year Arts Management student. I particularly enjoy bringing a community together through the performing arts. Before coming to graduate school, though, I was an elementary music teacher in South Texas which is actually where I grew up. I spent four years as a teacher learning about the relationship between data and the public education system while actually having fun reaffirming how amazingly powerful the arts and culture are in a child's life and their community.

I am currently working with data at my internship with the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council. 

**What I Hope to Learn**

Ilove where data and the arts intersect because it enhances experiences and the design and creation of further experiences. Through this class, I hope to become better at visualizing data to communicate with all stakeholders. Along with the skills to create high quality data visuals with my work, I want to be able to more efficiently challenge data presented to me particularly to become a more involved and active citizen.
