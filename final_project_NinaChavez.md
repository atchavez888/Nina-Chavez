Story arc explanation:

The [World Inequality Databse on Education](https://www.education-inequalities.org/about) is the data being utilized in this project. It can be accessed via the link above and clicking on the link labeled "Download Data in CSV Format." According to the site:
>About WIDE
>The World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) brings together data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator >Cluster Surveys (MICS), other national household surveys and learning assessments from over 160 countries. Users can compare education >outcomes between countries, and between groups within countries, according to factors that are associated with inequality, including >wealth, gender, and ethnicity and location. Users can also create maps, charts, infographics and tables from the data, and download, >print or share them online.

>The database was first created as the Deprivation and Marginalization in Education (DME) dataset for the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring >Report and re-launched as WIDE with interactive online features in 2012. In November 2018, the Global Education Monitoring Report and the >UNESCO Institute for Statistics established a partnership to jointly maintain and develop WIDE to support the monitoring of SDG 4 and in >particular target 4.5 on equity.
