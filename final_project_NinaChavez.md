This project will explore the gender desparities in education currently ongoing across the world in order to continue the campaign to advocate for 
>According to the [2018 United Nations The Sustainable Development Goals Report] (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2018),"...more than half of children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. Refocused efforts are needed to improve the quality of education.

**THE DATA**

The [World Inequality Databse on Education (WIDE)](https://www.education-inequalities.org/about) is the data being utilized in this project. It can be accessed via the link above and clicking on the link labeled "Download Data in CSV Format." According to the site:
>About WIDE
The World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) brings together data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), other national household surveys and learning assessments from over 160 countries. Users can compare education outcomes between countries, and between groups within countries, according to factors that are associated with inequality, including wealth, gender, and ethnicity and location. Users can also create maps, charts, infographics and tables from the data, and download, print or share them online.

>The database was first created as the Deprivation and Marginalization in Education (DME) dataset for the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring Report and re-launched as WIDE with interactive online features in 2012. In November 2018, the Global Education Monitoring Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics established a partnership to jointly maintain and develop WIDE to support the monitoring of **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4** and in >particular **target 4.5** on equity.

[**Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), Target 4.5**](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4)
>About Sustainable Development Goal 4
In September 2015, at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York, Member States formally adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda contains 17 goals, one of which, SDG 4, is to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’. SDG 4 has seven targets and three means of implementation. Target 4.5 focuses on equity and calls upon Member States to ‘eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and children in vulnerable situations’.
