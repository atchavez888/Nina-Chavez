## **SKETCHES & STORYBOARDS**

I struggled to sketch out what core infographics would be useful and clear to support the positive opening to the presentation. I received some useful tips for this point in the presentation from feedback. I'll be collecting more data and dig deepre into what I currently have from Teach for All and other sources to help with this issue. Before viewing the feedback I did manage to sketch out this:

I also struggled to sketch out the core infographics to paint a realistic picture of the current global education gaps and inequities. I'll be exploring the data I have collected further along with the feedback received.

## **USER RESEARCH PROTOCOL**

**1. Target Audience**

>The target audience for this presentation will be the Teach for All Board of Directors and Global Ambassadors as they plan the next 10-year strategic plan for the organization. They lead the decision making process of the organization, have the clout and relationships to tackle and begin selecting and engaging the next potential national chapters of the Teach for All network. They led the decisions in selecting and developing the current 46 chapters Teach for All and will continue that mission using the data from this presentation. 

  * **Board Members:** 18 (13 males, 5 females)
  * **Global Ambassadors:** 2 (1 male, 1 female)

**2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**

>To select individuals to interview and review the progress of my sketches and wirefream, I wanted to have a pool of candidates connected in one or another to education or public policy as well as individuals not directly working or studying those subjects. I selected two current educators, a former educator now working in marketing and development for a national charter school, peers in the graduate school PPM and MAM programs and an undergraduate at Pitt studying cyber security.

**3. Interview Script**

My interview script is a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWbKrKVDqOWSsyX0L4IJTHxHIEFyquYV4r39r4BTgIUkUm1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) which allowed structure in reviewing the feedback I received to each question. The form itself is accessible below.

**4. Interview Findings**

From the interviews, I received the [following feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TF5Vdd2Z5u3QCpivBIbNvIBHHfGLx0VaAz0ssSvRSZ4/edit?usp=sharing).

**5. Changes Implemented**
  
  * **Current Teach for All Map: Clarity** 
    * For this map, I realized that many viewers wanted to know the names of the countries already a part of the network. They also suggested improving the title to include something such as "as of 2019." How can I 
  
  * **Positive Impacts of TFA as of 2019:**
  
  * **Disparities**:
  
  * **Scatterplot**
    * I will overlay a map to correspond with the dots. I also would like to figure out how to make the map and scatterplot interactive so as a viewer reviews it, they can gain additional information such as the country's name and maybe the current population that should be in school for a specific age range.
  
  * Common feedback focused on the title. Perhaps something along the lines of "Looking Forward, Potential Partners 2020-2030"
