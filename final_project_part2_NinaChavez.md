# Final Project, Part II: Sketches, Wireframes, Storyboards

## **SKETCHES & STORYBOARDS**

I struggled to sketch out what core infographics would be useful and clear to support the positive opening to the presentation. I received some useful tips for this point in the presentation from feedback. I'll be collecting more data and dig deepre into what I currently have from Teach for All and other sources to help with this issue. Before viewing the feedback I did manage to sketch out this:

I also struggled to sketch out the core infographics to paint a realistic picture of the current global education gaps and inequities. I'll be exploring the data I have collected further along with the feedback received.

## **USER RESEARCH PROTOCOL**

**1. Target Audience**

>The target audience for this presentation will be the Teach for All Board of Directors and Global Ambassadors as they plan the next 10-year strategic plan for the organization. They lead the decision making process of the organization, have the clout and relationships to tackle and begin selecting and engaging the next potential national chapters of the Teach for All network. They led the decisions in selecting and developing the current 46 chapters Teach for All and will continue that mission using the data from this presentation. 

  * **Board Members:** 18 (13 males, 5 females)
  * **Global Ambassadors:** 2 (1 male, 1 female)

**2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**

>To select individuals to interview and review the progress of my sketches and wirefream, I wanted to have a pool of candidates connected in one or another to education or public policy as well as individuals not directly working or studying those subjects. I selected two current educators, a former educator now working in marketing and development for a national charter school, peers in the graduate school PPM and MAM programs and an undergraduate at Pitt studying cyber security.

**3. Interview Script**

My interview script is a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWbKrKVDqOWSsyX0L4IJTHxHIEFyquYV4r39r4BTgIUkUm1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) which allowed structure in reviewing the feedback I received to each question. The form itself is accessible below.

**4. Interview Findings**

From the interviews, I received the [following feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TF5Vdd2Z5u3QCpivBIbNvIBHHfGLx0VaAz0ssSvRSZ4/edit?usp=sharing).

**5. Changes Implemented**
  
  * **Storyboard**
    * Clear. Overall received accurate responses to the storyboard.
  
  * **Current Teach for All Network: Clarity** 
    * For this map, I realized that many viewers wanted to know the names of the countries already a part of the network. They also suggested improving the title to include something such as "as of 2019." 
    
    * I originally began Wireframing in Datawrapper but found that Infogram's setup for mapping allowed me to add in an interactive means to display: each country's name, year the partnership was established and the actual name of the chapter. That should clarify a bit more historical and name recognition for the audience especially if they interact with my Shorthand website for the final.
  
  * **Positive Impacts of TFA as of 2019:**
    * I needed a lot of help designing this cluster of infographics. Overall, though, it seems like I should sit down with Max, the TA, and flesh this out this week.
  
**RESPONSES INCLUDED:**
 
>* "School attendance rates over time since joining"
     * "Numbers of schools involved or touched by Teach for All"
     * "I think a graphic showing an increasing number of children completing high school or its equivalent abroad would be helpful or maybe a graphic showing the increase in country GDP since TFAll started an operation in that country. It could show the impact education has on the economy of the country."
  
  * **Disparities**:
   * I needed some help with this cluster of infographics but not so much because I was more comfortable extracting some data from the sets I currently have. Viewers did understand the goals I had. Overall, though, it seems like I should sit down with Max, the TA, and flesh this out this week.
   
**RESPONSES INCLUDED:**  

>  * "Improve title"
   * "For location, include a map."
   * "Develop this idea that actually integrates the disparities. They seem very disconnected especially for someone not familiar."
   * "Pictograms"
  
  * **Scatterplot**
    * There was strong clarity in understanding this visual and positive responses overall.
    * I will overlay a map to correspond with the dots. I also would like to figure out how to make the map and scatterplot interactive so as a viewer reviews it, they can gain additional information such as the country's name and maybe the current population that should be in school for a specific age range. I should improve the title - perhaps something along the lines of "Looking Forward, Potential Partners 2020-2030"
    
**RESPONSES INCLUDED**

>  * "Clarify Y-axis"
   * "Color-code will be key."
   * "This will be a strong visual, so clarity overall will be very necessary."
