**2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**

>To select individuals to interview and review the progress of my sketches and wirefream, I wanted to have a pool of candidates connected in one or another to education or public policy as well as individuals not directly working or studying those subjects. I selected two current educators, a former educator now working in marketing and development for a national charter school, peers in the graduate school PPM and MAM programs and an undergraduate at Pitt studying cyber security.

**3. Interview Script**

My interview script is a Google Form which allowed structure in reviewing the feedback I received to each question. The form itself is accessible below.
